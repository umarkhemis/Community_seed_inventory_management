    mkdir community_seedbank-management
    cd seedbank-management

# Set Up MySQL Database

    bash   ## Access MySQL as root
    sudo mysql -u root -p
    
    ## Create database and import schema
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE seedbank_db;
    mysql> USE seedbank_db;
    mysql> SOURCE /path/to/your/project/db/db_schema.sql;
    mysql> EXIT;

# Configure Database Connection
## Edit src/Database.php in VS Code:

    php   private $host = 'localhost';
    private $username = 'root';        // Your MySQL username
    private $password = 'your_password'; // Your MySQL password
    private $database = 'seedbank_db';



# Start PHP Development Server

bash   # Navigate to the public directory
   cd public
   
   # Start PHP built-in server
   php -S localhost:8000
   
   # Server will start on http://localhost:8000


# Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:

   http://localhost:8000/index.php


# Usage Guide

## Managing Seeds
### Adding New Seeds

    ####Navigate to "Add New Seed" from the main menu
    ####Fill in the required fields:

        #### Seed Name (e.g., "Tomato")
        #### Variety (e.g., "Cherokee Purple")
        #### Type (Vegetable, Fruit, Herb, Flower, Grain)
        #### Donor information

        #### Optionally add quantity, collection date, and description

    #### Click "Add Seed" to save

# Viewing & Editing Seeds

    ## Browse All: Main dashboard shows all seeds in a grid layout
    ## View Details: Click "View Details" for complete information and            ##transaction history
    ## Edit: Click "Edit" to modify seed information
    ## Delete: Click "Delete" to remove seeds (includes confirmation dialog)

# Transaction Management

    ## Record Deposits: When community members contribute seeds
    ## Track Withdrawals: When seeds are distributed to gardeners
    ## Automatic Quantity Updates: Stock levels update automatically with each ## transaction

# Sample Data
    ## The system comes with sample seed varieties to help you get started:

        ### Cherry Red Tomatoes (150 seeds)
        ### Buttercrunch Lettuce (200 seeds)
        ### French Dwarf Marigolds (80 seeds)
        ### Sweet Genovese Basil (120 seeds)

# Technical Implementation
## Database Design
    ### Seeds Table

        #### Primary information about each seed variety
        #### Donor details and contact information
        #### Stock quantities and collection dates
        #### Timestamps for audit trails

    # Transactions Table

        #### Records all seed movements (deposits/withdrawals)
        #### Links to seeds via foreign key relationship
        #### Member information for accountability
        #### Transaction dates and notes


# Security Features

    ## Prepared Statements: All database queries use prepared statements to ##prevent SQL injection

    ## Error Handling: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
    ## XSS Protection: Output escaping using htmlspecialchars()

# Code Architecture

Database Class: Centralized connection management with error handling
Seed Model: Complete CRUD operations with prepared statements
Separation of Concerns: Clean separation between data access, business logic, and presentation
Responsive Design: Mobile-first CSS approach



## Database Extensions
    ##Easy to extend with additional tables:

        ### Planting schedules
        ### Growing instructions
        ### Harvest records
        ### Member management

# Troubleshooting
    ## Common Issues
    ## Database Connection Errors

    ## Verify MySQL service is running: sudo systemctl status mysql
    ## Check credentials in src/Database.php
    ## Ensure database seedbank_db exists: mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW DATABASES;"

    ## PHP Server Issues

        ### Ensure PHP is installed: php --version
        ### Check if MySQLi extension is enabled: php -m | grep mysqli
        ### Restart PHP server if needed: Ctrl+C then php -S localhost:8000

    ## Permission Errors

        ### Ensure your user has read/write permissions to project directory
        ### Check MySQL user permissions for database access

    ## Port Already in Use

        ### If port 8000 is busy, use different port: php -S localhost:8080
        ### Check running processes: netstat -tulpn | grep 8000

    

## Useful Ubuntu/PHP commands:

## bash  # Check PHP version and extensions
  php --version
  php -m
  
  # Monitor MySQL service
  sudo systemctl status mysql
  
  # View PHP error logs
  tail -f /var/log/php_errors.log
  
  # Quick MySQL access
  sudo mysql -u root -p

## VS Code Extensions for PHP Development:

    ## PHP Extension Pack
    ## PHP Intelephense
   
   


    Use browser developer tools to debug frontend issues
    Check MySQL error logs: sudo tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log

# Future Enhancements
    Potential improvements for extended development:

    ## User Authentication: Login system for multiple administrators
    ## Advanced Search: Filter seeds by type, donor, or availability
    ## Reporting: Generate PDF reports of inventory and transactions
    ## API Integration: REST API for mobile app integration
    ## Image Upload: Photo management for seed varieties
    ## Notification System: Alerts for low stock or upcoming planting dates
